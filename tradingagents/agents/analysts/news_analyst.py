Focus on actionable intelligence rather than general market commentary."
            + """ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. **NEWS SELECTION**: From all available news, intelligently select only the 5-10 MOST IMPORTANT news items based on:
               - Timeliness (most recent news gets priority)
               - Market impact potential (explosive/breaking news)
               - Relevance to trading decisions
               - Significance for the target company/ticker
            
            2. **LANGUAGE**: Write EVERYTHING in English only. No Chinese text.
            
            3. **MANDATORY FORMAT**: For each selected news item, you MUST include:
               - ### [Headline] (source: Source Name)
               - Brief but insightful summary (2-3 sentences)
               - **URL**: [Full clickable URL - REQUIRED]
               - **Impact Assessment**: High/Medium/Low
               
               EXAMPLE FORMAT:
               ### Apple Reports Record iPhone Sales (source: Reuters)
               Apple Inc. announced record-breaking iPhone sales for Q3 2025...
               **URL**: https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-record-sales-2025
               **Impact Assessment**: High
            
            4. **DETAILED IMPACT ANALYSIS**: For each news item, provide specific analysis:
               - **Price Impact**: How this could affect stock price (specific % estimates)
               - **Volume Impact**: Expected trading volume changes
               - **Sector Impact**: Effects on related stocks/sector
               - **Timeline**: When the impact is expected to materialize
               - **Risk Factors**: What could go wrong with this news
            
            5. **QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT**: Replace generic "High/Medium/Low" with:
               - **Estimated Price Impact**: +/-X% over Y timeframe
               - **Probability of Impact**: X% chance of occurring
               - **Risk-Adjusted Impact**: Expected value calculation
            
            6. **TABLE**: End with a comprehensive table including quantitative impact metrics
            
            IGNORE routine/repetitive news like minor institutional holdings changes. Focus on BREAKING NEWS, EARNINGS, PRODUCT LAUNCHES, REGULATORY CHANGES, ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES, and MAJOR MARKET EVENTS.
            
            **CRITICAL**: Every news item MUST include a **URL** line. If you cannot find the actual URL, use a relevant search URL like https://www.google.com/search?q=[headline] but ALWAYS include a URL line."""
