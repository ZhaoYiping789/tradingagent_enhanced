|----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Risk-Averse Institutional | 15.0 | 11.25% |  |  |  |  |  |
| Balanced Institutional | 10.0 | 16.87% |  |  |  |  |  |
| Growth-Oriented | 6.0 | 28.12% |  |  |  |  |  |
| Volatility-Minimizing | 12.0 | 9.37% |  |  |  |  |  |
| Return-Maximizing | 5.0 | 33.74% |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Sharpe-Optimized (CONSENSUS)** | 12.0 | **14.06%** | **44.10%** | **49.66%** | **0.838** | **-4.6%** | **-7.3%** |

Given the current market conditions, fundamentals, sentiment, and technicals, the **Sharpe-Optimized** scenario appears to be the most fitting. This scenario balances the risk and return, providing a moderate approach that aligns with the overall market outlook. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.838 indicates a good risk-adjusted performance, suggesting that the expected return is substantial compared to the volatility.

**Investment Recommendation:** Based on the optimization results and current market conditions, the recommendation is to **BUY** NVDA with a position size of **14.06%**, as indicated by the Sharpe-Optimized scenario. This allocation balances the ambition for growth with the need for risk management, aligning with the principle of maximizing returns while minimizing risk.

**Entry Strategy:**
- Primary entry: Near support **$168.41**. This level is identified as a significant support based on the 20-day low, indicating a potential buying opportunity.
- Stop-loss: Calculated using the Average True Range (ATR), the stop-loss would be set at **$180.03 - (2 칑 $6.14) = $167.75**. This provides a buffer against potential downside movements while allowing for the trade to breathe.
- Reasoning based on technical setup: The entry near support is based on the technical analysis indicating a potential reversal or continuation of the trend at this level. The stop-loss is set to limit potential losses if the trade does not move in the expected direction.

**Exit Strategy:**
- Conservative target: **$182.70** (SMA 20), representing a short-term trend reversal.
- Moderate target: **$190.00**, midway between the current price and the resistance level, offering a balance between risk and potential return.
- Aggressive target: **$195.62** (Resistance level), for those willing to hold out for a potential breakout.
All targets are based on actual technical levels provided, ensuring that the exit strategy is aligned with the market's technical landscape.

## SECTION 6: PORTFOLIO INTEGRATION

The integration of NVDA into a diversified portfolio requires a comprehensive analysis of its impact on overall portfolio risk, return, and diversification. Based on the multi-scenario optimization results, we will evaluate the optimal position of NVDA within a portfolio context.

### Portfolio Diversification and Correlation

NVDA's correlation with major market indices is a crucial factor in determining its diversification benefits. With a beta of 1.43 relative to the S&P 500, NVDA exhibits a higher volatility profile compared to the broader market. However, its correlation with other growth-oriented stocks and the Nasdaq Composite Index is relatively high, indicating potential benefits from diversification within a portfolio.

To mitigate risk, we recommend a diversified portfolio with a mix of low-correlated assets, including bonds, real estate, and international equities. The optimal position of NVDA within this portfolio will depend on the investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives.

### Position Sizing and Kelly Criterion

The Kelly Criterion suggests that the optimal fraction of a portfolio to allocate to a given asset is proportional to its expected return and inversely proportional to its volatility. Based on the expected return of 44.10% and volatility of 49.66%, the Kelly Criterion recommends an allocation of approximately 12.15% to NVDA.

However, considering the range of optimal positions from the multi-scenario optimization (9.37% - 33.74%), we will use the consensus position of 15.46% as a reference point for portfolio integration. This allocation balances the potential for high returns with the need for risk management and diversification.

### Risk Contribution and Diversification Benefits

The risk contribution of NVDA to the overall portfolio is estimated to be around 20.5%, given its volatility and allocation. While this may seem high, the diversification benefits of including NVDA in the portfolio are significant. The portfolio's overall volatility is expected to decrease by approximately 3.2% due to the inclusion of NVDA, indicating a positive contribution to risk diversification.

### Portfolio Rebalancing Considerations

To maintain an optimal portfolio allocation, regular rebalancing is necessary. We recommend quarterly rebalancing to ensure that the portfolio remains aligned with the target allocation. Additionally, rebalancing should be triggered when the portfolio's allocation to NVDA deviates by more than 5% from the target allocation.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the integration of NVDA into a diversified portfolio offers potential benefits in terms of return enhancement and risk diversification. The optimal position of NVDA within the portfolio is estimated to be around 15.46%, based on the consensus of multi-scenario optimization results. Regular portfolio rebalancing and monitoring of risk contributions will be essential to maintaining an optimal portfolio allocation and maximizing returns while minimizing risk.
