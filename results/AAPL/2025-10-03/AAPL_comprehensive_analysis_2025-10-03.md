**STEP 4: Final Position Size Decision with Explicit Reasoning**

```
OPTIMIZATION GUIDANCE: 10.64% (conservative) to 31.91% (aggressive), Consensus: 14.62%

INTEGRATION ANALYSIS:
‚úì Fundamentals: Strong (profit margins 18.3%) ‚Üí Supports HIGHER position
‚úì Sentiment: Bullish from earnings report ‚Üí Supports HIGHER position  
‚úó Technicals: RSI 78.4 (overbought), Moderate volatility 21.07% ‚Üí Suggests LOWER position
‚úó Bear Case: Competition risks, economic slowdown ‚Üí Suggests CAUTION

FINAL DECISION: 15% position
RATIONALE: Optimization supports up to 31.91% for growth while fundamentals are solid, but high RSI (78.4) indicates potential for cooling-off which suggests moderate positioning.

**E. Execution Timeline with Detailed Rationale**

- **Week 1-2:** Monitor RSI cooling below 75, engage conservative entry near $226.65 - WHY: Align adjustments with dynamic support levels recognizing near-term reversals potential.
- **Week 3-4:** Evaluate medium-term positioning at SMA levels, prepared for adjustments - WHY: Recognizing trend establishment in technical retracement points.
- **Month 2:** Consider phase-in larger position if market signals reflect stabilization or expansion beyond resistance - WHY: Utilize S/R observations for optimal strategic placement post price behavior stabilization.
- **Quarterly:** Continuous oversight of performance vs. broader economic shifts, modifying exits as warranted - WHY: Adaptive balance ensuring strategic foresight and risk mitigation pursuits.

**F. Scenario-Based Adjustments**

- **Bull case (+3.5%):** If sustained above $259, monitor continued engagement into additional position expansion BECAUSE broader market supportive trends exhibit projecting increases.
- **Base case:** If trending along consolidation within identified support/resistance, assess market movements and adjust holdings proportionately for stable target realization BECAUSE trend confirmation supports logical strategy progression.
- **Bear case (-3.0%):** If declining below $230, consider partial liquidation or strategic hedge against market volatility signals BECAUSE downturn likely elevates risk factors in consideration of competitive landscape and economic pressures.
