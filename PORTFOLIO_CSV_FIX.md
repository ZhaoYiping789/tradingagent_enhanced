# Portfolio CSV Export Fix

## Issue Summary

When running portfolio mode with multiple stocks (e.g., NVDA and AAPL), the system completed individual stock analyses successfully, but portfolio optimization failed with:

```
⚠️ Portfolio optimization requires at least 2 stocks with complete CSV data. Found 0 stock(s).
```

## Root Cause

The interactive workflow in `flask_chat_app.py` was **not exporting CSV files** when completing each stock in portfolio mode.

The portfolio optimizer (`StockDataAggregator`) looks for CSV data at:
```
results/{TICKER}/{DATE}/csv_data/
```

But the interactive workflow was only saving in-memory results to `portfolio_results` dictionary without calling the CSV exporter.

## Files Affected

- `flask_chat_app.py` (lines 1166-1173)

## Fix Applied

Added CSV export code after each stock completes in portfolio mode:

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Export CSV data for portfolio optimization
try:
    from tradingagents.portfolio.csv_data_exporter import CSVDataExporter
    csv_exporter = CSVDataExporter(current_ticker, portfolio_trade_date)
    exported_files = csv_exporter.export_all_data(controller.workflow_state.agent_state)
    print(f"[PORTFOLIO] Exported {len(exported_files)} CSV files for {current_ticker}", flush=True)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[PORTFOLIO] Warning: Failed to export CSV for {current_ticker}: {str(e)}", flush=True)
```

## CSV Files Exported

For each stock, the following CSV files are now exported to `results/{TICKER}/{DATE}/csv_data/`:

1. `financial_metrics.csv` - Fundamental financial data (revenue, profit margins, ROE, etc.)
2. `technical_indicators.csv` - Technical analysis data (RSI, MACD, SMA, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
3. `risk_metrics.csv` - Risk measures (VaR, CVaR, max drawdown, volatility)
4. `optimization_scenarios.csv` - Quantitative optimization results
5. `sentiment_analysis.csv` - News and social media sentiment scores
6. `summary_metrics.csv` - Aggregated summary metrics

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Portfolio mode analyzed stocks but couldn't run portfolio optimization
- User received "Found 0 stock(s)" error even after completing all analyses

**After Fix:**
- Each stock exports CSV files automatically upon completion
- Portfolio optimizer can successfully load and aggregate data from all analyzed stocks
- Multi-scenario portfolio optimization runs successfully
- Portfolio report is generated with optimal allocations

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run a 2-stock portfolio analysis (e.g., NVDA + AAPL)
2. Verify CSV files are created in `results/NVDA/{DATE}/csv_data/` and `results/AAPL/{DATE}/csv_data/`
3. Confirm portfolio optimization completes successfully
4. Check portfolio report is generated in `portfolio_results/{DATE}/`

## Related Fixes (From Previous Session)

These fixes were also applied in the same workflow:

### Fix 1: Analyst Index Reset (Line 1277-1279)
**Issue:** "No analyst to run" error when switching to second stock
**Cause:** `current_analyst_index` wasn't reset to 0 when initializing new stock
**Fix:** Manual reset to 0 after `controller.initialize()`

### Fix 2: Optimization Preference Persistence (Lines 1258, 1280)
**Issue:** System re-asked for optimization preferences for each stock
**Cause:** `portfolio_optimization_preference` global variable not properly declared
**Fix:** Added to global declaration and fixed print statement key

## Final Status

✅ All portfolio mode issues resolved:
- ✅ Analyst index reset when switching stocks
- ✅ Optimization preferences saved and reused
- ✅ CSV data exported for portfolio aggregation
- ✅ Portfolio optimization runs successfully
