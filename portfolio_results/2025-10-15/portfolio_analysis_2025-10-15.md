**FINAL RECOMMENDED ALLOCATION:**

- **NVDA**: 67.30%
- **AAPL**: 32.70%

**Portfolio Manager Detailed Analysis:**
After analyzing the individual stock analysis, quantitative optimization results, and market context, I have decided to allocate 67.3% to NVDA and 32.7% to AAPL. NVDA's strong fundamental analysis, with a revenue of $165.2B and a profit margin of 52.4%, combined with its technical analysis showing a current price of $180.00 and an RSI of 50.0, indicates a bullish sentiment. Additionally, NVDA's risk analysis shows an expected return of 15.0% and a Sharpe ratio of 0.500, which is higher than AAPL's expected return of 12.0% and Sharpe ratio of 0.500. The quantitative optimization results also support this allocation, with the Maximum Sharpe Ratio scenario allocating 68.000% to NVDA and 32.000% to AAPL. Considering the current market conditions of moderate volatility in the tech environment, I believe this allocation balances risk management with return potential. The market context suggests that tech stocks are experiencing moderate volatility, which aligns with NVDA's higher expected return and Sharpe ratio. Therefore, I have chosen this allocation to maximize returns while managing risk.

**Confidence Level:** 8/10
**Time Horizon:** 6-12 months
**Preferred Optimization Approach:** Modified Maximum Sharpe with risk adjustments

**Key Decision Factors:**
- Strong fundamental analysis of NVDA
- Bullish sentiment of NVDA
- Higher expected return and Sharpe ratio of NVDA
- Moderate volatility in the tech environment
